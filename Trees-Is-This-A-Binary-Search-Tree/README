Original problem found here https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree

This one gave me a bit of trouble since I didn't fully consider the rules of a tree when I implemented. Two solutions are provided
here. One is mine which was able to accomplish all the test cases except for two and the other is one derived from assisting videos
and help from the comment section. Sadly my solution is very sloppy and I'm not at all happy with it. This problem has just shown
me that I have a bit of a weakness when it comes to BST.
