Original problem found here https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-queue-using-two-stacks

I really liked this problem. To improve speeds you use the first stack to keep loading values until pop (dequeue) or print front of queue
is called. If the oldest_on_top stack is empty, you populate it, otherwise you simply use as is.
