# [Original Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree/#/description)

My run time compared to others was pretty slow. I think this could be improved by using a helper method that passes a int begin and int end.
This would prevent the need to create new vector<int>'s for every call which not only saves time, but space as well.
