# [Original Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-index/#/description)

Did solid solving this problem from knowledge of working on a previous [problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-random-node/#/description).
The method of solving was pretty much the same thing. I would have liked if the problem stated if the array was sorted or not.
